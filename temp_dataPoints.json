The roots stay alive throughout the rest of the year and the plant grows back every spring. Wild lupine flowers can be blue, pink or white. Wild lupine is the only lupine native to Michigan. Wild lupine, or sundial, is the larval host to the threatened karner blue butterfly. The karner blue’s larvae feed solely on wild lupine, so it is vital to increase the density of this plant population. The karner blue butterfly is a federally listed endangered species and is a threatened species in Michigan."
